# SierpinskiTriangles
Computing IV Small Project

This project simulates an animation of the Sierpinski recursive triangle algorithm by taking two command line arguments, side length and recursion depth, and then constructing an object from a drawable Triangle class using the SFML drawing library. The program recursively draws the triangles by calling function fTree() three times, changing the center position to the points of the triangle drawn in the current call.
The program draws each triangle to the window, with an offset to the length by 1⁄8 for centerX and centerY when passing it to the recursive calls, because SFML draws
shapes off from the window edges by about 1⁄8 of the shape’s center. The color feature, which produces a gradient color effect, is generated by the recursive call, setting the color elements of each triangle to a proportion of its position. However, the highest centerX and centerY that can successfully create a color is 510 for both of them, because the RGB elements of the pixel cannot exceed 255, and the setFillColor() function sets the RGB elements to half of centerX and centerY. An added feature after getting the project running as desired was the animation feature, which was implemented by changing the position with a framerate limit.
